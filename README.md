# ðŸŒŽ Tale of Biomes
Tale of Biomes is a Minecraft mod that I am working on as part of the MCreator Lore series on my YouTube channel NorthWestTrees MCreator. Tale of Biomes adds a new dimension and an entirely new custom world full of new mechanics and features that expand the game's reach. Here you will find snapshots, releases, and documentation for the modification.

NorthWestTrees uses a couple of programs for planning the modification [Leonardo](https://www.getleonardo.com/) and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) as well as GitHub for feature requests, wiki, and bug tracking. All textures and assets are made by NorthWestTrees and produced using [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) and [PaintDotNet](https://getpaint.net/). And of course, this would not be possible without [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) the software used to make the Minecraft mod.

## ðŸ§ª Release Types
### Snapshots
Snapshots are not designed for regular use, like most mods, they will contain bugs and may cause issues with your world. It's best to only use them to find bugs and then report them to our issue tracker.

### Releases
Releases are designed for regular use, we currently don't have any set date when we will make the first release please keep in mind that NorthWestTrees only works on the mod for a few hours a week each week for the MCreator Lore series so development is slow but productive.

## ðŸ“ˆ Development Stages
### Indev
**Indev** short for "Indevelopment" is not even released, often just snapshots with ideas and small features. Mainly the start of the project.

### Alpha
This is often the first stage of release early on in development once there are enough features to release.
The goal is to release the mod once enough features have been added for the plains and grassland biomes.

### Beta
Once there are a few updates and more content added to the game the mod will reach beta, the next stage of development that will be a bit more stable but may also take longer time for releases.

### Released
Once the mod has been fully developed mod will enter a released stage and then be maintained from that point on. This will sadly be the end of the line for the Lore series but don't worry its been 40ish episodes so far and we are not even done one biome so we have tones more videos to come!
