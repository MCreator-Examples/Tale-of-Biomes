# 🌎 Tale of Biomes
Tale of Biomes is a Minecraft mod that I am working on as part of the MCreator Lore series on my YouTube channel NorthWestTrees MCreator. Tale of Biomes adds a new dimension and an entirely new custom world full of new mechanics and features that expand the game's reach. Here you will find snapshots, releases, and documentation for the modification.

NorthWestTrees uses a couple of programs for planning the modification [Leonardo](https://www.getleonardo.com/) and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) as well as GitHub for feature requests, wiki, and bug tracking. All textures and assets are made by NorthWestTrees and produced using [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) and [PaintDotNet](https://getpaint.net/). And of course, this would not be possible without [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) the software used to make the Minecraft mod.
